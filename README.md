# minding-the-gap
Codebase to investigate correlation of preference gap between rich and poor and policy adoption rates.  The dataset (gilens_data_sm_copy.csv) is a subset of the dataset procured by Prof. Martin Gilens located at https://www.russellsage.org/economic-inequality-and-political-representation

# Usage
1. slope_vs_p90_adoption_plotter.py plots adoption rate vs (p90 - p10) and p90.
2. slope_vs_p90_adoption_calculator.py used byslope_vs_p90_adoption_plotter.py to calculate adoption rates broken about by dataset standard deviations.
3. slope_vs_p90_vs_netIGA_adoption_plotter.py slope_vs_p90_adoption_plotter.py plots adoption rate vs (p90 - p10), p90, and netIGA.
4. slope_vs_p90_vs_netIGA_adoption_calculator.py used by slope_vs_p90_vs_netIGA_adoption_plotter.py to calculate adoption rates broken about by dataset standard deviations.
